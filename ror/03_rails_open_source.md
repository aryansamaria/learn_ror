### Rails Open-source 
Working with open-source is a great way to learn about how every-changing softwares work with rails to get things done. It gives you practical world experience of using rails outside of tutorials and simple crud apps. But, how do you find a good open-source project to contribute to and how do you even get started. 

Find a project that has an active maintainer and shows interest in getting newcomers started. Someone who reviews PRs frequently and genrally supports and guides you as you make  contribution to the project. Have a conversation with them about your intent and how you can work together.

To get started, don't jump right into fixing an issue.
- First, try to setup your environment locally and get familiar with the key features of the product.
- Second, read the open and closed pull requests to get an idea of how development and review process and culture works. 
- Thirdly, read the open issues/tasks that need to be taken upon. Pick some that are important and are interesting to you. Start with small issues to get familiar with the codebase and community. Move on to large issues and lower level infra related stuffs down the line. Build good working relationships with the maintainers is very important here to be successfull.
