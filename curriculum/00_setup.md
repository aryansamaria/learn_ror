### Setup

This is a an opinionated guide for rails setup. Here we will install 
- rbenv to install and manage ruby versions. You will need to install `rbenv` and `rbenv-build` to install and manage several ruby versions. 
- VS code with Ruby LSP extension and github copilot. I considered Rubymine and Neovim as well. Rubymine is bloated and not worth it while Neovim is harder to learn for most people unless you are a vim fanatic. Ruby LSP is great for following a symbol or method. If Ruby LSP is not working, you may need to grep in the gems directory of the installed gems. Rails documentation is great and it would be a missed opportunity not to read it.
